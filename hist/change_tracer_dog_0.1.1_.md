## `%dog_chatter()` macro <a name="dogchatter-macro-1"></a> ######

Macro:    %dog_chatter
  Purpose:  Hidden easter egg macro. 
            Makes the "Police Dog" talk in the SAS log with fun messages.
            Each call rotates through ~50 different lines of dog chatter.
 
  Example:
    %dog_chatter
    %dog_chatter
    %dog_chatter
 
   ????????????

## `%dog_patrol()` macro <a name="dogpatrol-macro-2"></a> ######

Macro:    %dog_patrol
  Purpose:  Start patrol by enabling dataset generations. 
            The police dog begins sniffing the target dataset and 
            monitors its changes up to a specified generation limit.
 
  Parameters:
    lib=         Library containing the dataset (default=WORK).
    target=      Target dataset to patrol (REQUIRED).
    sniff_limit= Maximum number of generations to keep (default=5).
 
  Behavior:
    - If target is missing, the dog barks angrily (ERROR message).
    - Otherwise, proc datasets is used to enable generation tracking.
    - A playful message is displayed confirming patrol start.
 
  Example:
    data test;
    do X = 1 to 10;
      output;
    end;
    run;
    data wk1;
      set test;
      if X > 5 then cat="A"; else cat="B";
    run;
    %dog_patrol(target=wk1)

## `%patrol_end()` macro <a name="patrolend-macro-3"></a> ######

Macro:    %patrol_end
  Purpose:  End patrol by resetting generation tracking. 
            The police dog stops monitoring and returns to the kennel.
 
  Parameters:
    lib=     Library containing the dataset (default=WORK).
    target=  Target dataset to stop patrolling (REQUIRED).
 
  Behavior:
    - If target is missing, the dog growls (ERROR message).
    - Otherwise, proc datasets resets GENMAX=0 to disable generations.
    - Displays a message confirming the patrol has ended.
 
  Example:
    %patrol_end(target=wk1)

  
---
 
## `%sniffer_compare()` macro <a name="sniffercompare-macro-4"></a> ######

Macro:    %sniffer_compare
  Purpose:  Compare the current dataset with one of its generations. 
            The police dog "sniffs" both versions to detect differences.
 
  Parameters:
    lib=        Library containing the dataset (default=WORK).
    target=     Target dataset to compare (REQUIRED).
    scent_age=  Generation number to compare against (default=-1,
                meaning the immediately previous generation).
 
  Behavior:
    - If target is missing, the dog growls angrily (ERROR message).
    - Uses PROC COMPARE to check differences between generations.
    - If &sysinfo=0 → Woof! Perfect match, no differences found.
    - Otherwise → Bark! Differences detected.
 
  Example:
    data wk1;
      set test;
      if X > 6 then cat="A"; else cat="B";
    run;
    %sniffer_compare(target=wk1, scent_age=-1)
